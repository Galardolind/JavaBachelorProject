# JavaBachelorProject

##Overview

This was my BSc project (2013)

This project was about creating a software with a web crawling agent to gather email addresses from web with specific requests (e.g. "zoo keeper","travel agent" etc...).

The mails gathered will be added to the database and then you can use the software to write and send an email to the gathered emails. The email can be personalized by adding keyword into it.

##Technologies

Used by the software : Java,MongoDB,SWING

Tests : jUnit and Mockito.
