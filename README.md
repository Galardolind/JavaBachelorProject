# JavaBachelorProject
This was my BSc project (2013)

This project was about creating a software with a web crawling agent to gather email addresses from web with specific requests (e.g. "zoo keeper","travel agent" etc...).

The mails gathered will be added to the database and then you can use the software to write and send an email to the gathered emails. The email can be personalized by adding keyword into it.

/!\ Caution : use this software is forbidden into several countries. Plus you can be blacklisted by your provider if you wrongly use their SMTP (too much, too fast etc..).
